### Graph components: 

- title
- subtitle 
- legend
- axis labels 
- points (geometric object) 
- plot panel
- background panel
- major gridlines
- minor gridlines 

### Layers:

##### first

- data
- aesthetics
- geometric objects

##### then

- facets
- statistical transformations
- coordinates
- theme 

### Ask: (do first three before four!)
- is it correct

observations and experimental design --- avoid data wrangling and calculation mistakes 

- is it useful? for who?

accessibility! context! don't overwhelm people! 

- does it communicate data responsibly?

- does it look awesome? 

### Lecture 16: responsible data 
for each element: is this element necessary for audience understanding? is this the best way to encourage audience understanding?
