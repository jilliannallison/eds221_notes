### Unit testing: {testthat}
Unit test: formal, automated, check to make sure a piece ("unit") of your code is behaving expectedly. 

"Testing should be addictive, so you do it all the time"

Built in functions with common tests that people run on their functions to make sure they're working properly

* expect_equal(function, expected_value)

does it return expected values

* expect_type(function, expected_type) 

does it return expected types

* expect_length(function, expected_length)

does it return the expected length of vector

* expect_true(conditional statement about function ) 

does the function return true?
